# Internationalization for the NeXTPlan App

## Introduction
The NeXTPlan App supports multiple languages through internationalization. This allows users to view the app's content in their preferred language.

## What is Internationalization?
Internationalization is the process of designing and developing software so that it can be easily translated into different languages and regions. This is done by separating the text and other content from the source code and storing it in separate files. These files are then translated into the desired languages.

## String Interpolation
Although not implemented in this Library but rather implemented client-side, the Strings are interpolateable so you can put in specific Data polled from the App. Here is a list of all "Reserved" Strings:
- `%name` the first Name of the App's User
- `%date` Current Date, as specified in the Date Format

## Contributing
If you would like to contribute translations for additional languages or improve existing translations, please follow these guidelines:

1. Fork the NeXTPlan repository.
2. Create a new branch for your translations.
3. Make the necessary changes to the language files.
4. Submit a pull request with your changes.
